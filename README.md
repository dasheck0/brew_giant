# Brew Giant

I've developed a small demo app that showcases the use of the PunkApi.

## Technologies

- **Paging3**: For seamless pagination of data, ensuring a smooth user experience even with large datasets.
- **Hilt**: Utilized for dependency injection, simplifying the management of dependencies and promoting clean, modular code.
- **Retrofit**: Enables effortless networking, allowing the app to interact with the PunkApi and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Jetpack Compose**: The cutting-edge UI toolkit from Google, used to build the app's user interface with ease.
- **Coil**: Ensuring fast and efficient loading of images within the app.

Feel free to explore the codebase and discover how these technologies work together to create a compelling user experience while interacting with the PunkApi. Happy coding!
